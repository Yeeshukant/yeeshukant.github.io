Although getting screened-in is still a gamble that a candidate has to take, after 8 attempts and 4 screen-outs, I have learned the following things that helped me get screened-in consecutively. I am sure these will help anyone as well, so that at least one is able to secure his Military Ration for at least 5 days;)<br>

### You are not different
After my graduation and securing a good placement from college, I went for my first attempt after a long gap. I thought that since I had graduated from a good school and college with fairly good grades and CGPA, I would surely be selected even without much preparation.<br>

My SSB center was Prayagraj (Allahabad), and I had to travel from Kochi. For the first time, I booked the most expensive flight journey of my life and reached the lodging place. The next day, I went in with confidence and gave my best with the limited preparation I had done, thinking my background would support me.<br>

The results were announced, and I got screened out. At that time, I realized that your screening depends only on your performance during the testing stage — nothing else matters. Whether you prepared hard or went casually, if your performance is better than others, you will be screened in.

### Choose the first feasible date for youself
This idea was given to me by one of the JCOs. He mentioned that many candidates hesitate to take the first slot in the name of preparation time. As a result, the reporting strength is usually lower, which inherently increases the chances of getting screened in.

### Perform "Flawless" in the tests
For freshers, this is the first set of tests conducted after document verification. The problems are designed to test the aptitude of the candidate through verbal and non-verbal reasoning questions. The questions range from easy to moderate but have a strict time limit. Preparation is a must to secure maximum correct answers, if not all. Many Telegram groups even have actual test booklet PDFs circulating. With a little search, you may find a test with exact questions if luck favors you. You have to be quick and accurate. A strong OIR performance may tilt the decision in your favor if the assessors are uncertain about your overall performance.<br>

PPDT - For picture perception and story writing, make sure you observe and imagine properly. I am a slow writer; therefore, I tried to be as concise as possible while writing my stories, following these principles:

- Maximum 1–2 lines for the introduction of the hero and the situation
- 4–6 lines describing the action, with at least two actions performed by the hero
- 1–2 lines for a clear conclusion

If you try to go overboard, you may end up with an unfinished story and create a negative impression on the psychologist. Write too little, and your story may lack substance. Find the sweet spot according to your writing speed.<br>

A complete story boosts confidence during narration. The narration has to be confident and crisp, within the time limit. Never try to explain — just narrate the events of your story. Any hesitation or fumbling during narration will most likely confirm your return journey.<br>

If you think you can compensate during the discussion, you may be out of luck. In a “fish market” discussion, a person whose narration was better but who did not speak much during discussion may still have better chances than someone who dominated the discussion but narrated poorly — especially in Navy and Air Force boards.<br>

Also, try to push your group forward during the discussion by quickly agreeing with valid points made by others and then adding your own points to continue the flow. Those who get fixated on their own points and argue excessively are generally seen carrying their luggage out of the gates.<br>

Remember, all stories are good. It does not matter whose story is selected as the common group story. There is no added advantage for the narrator of the final story. In fact, the narrator now faces the challenge of presenting a poorly organized group story confidently and without hesitation — an art only the best can master.

### Good luck!
