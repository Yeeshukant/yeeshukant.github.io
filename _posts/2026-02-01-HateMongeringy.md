Carried out openly in the name of spreading awareness, Hate mongering does more harm to ownself than simply "spreading awareness". Anyone can reflect from instances from their own lives where people actively participating in these activities live in paradox and denial of actual good, finding meanings in events and things which might have never been intented? A simple simple video of paying tribute to gods will be treated as blasphemous.
